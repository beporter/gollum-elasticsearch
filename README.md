# Gollum + Elasticsearch

Aims to integrate Elasticsearch features into the Gollum wiki project.

* [ ] Improved relevancy of search results.
* [ ] Ability to tune search results for specific topic domains.
* [ ] Find-as-you-type search results.
* [ ] Perhaps improved search performance in very large wikis(?) (Should be tested!)
* [ ] FUTURE: Per-user search conversion tracking.

Based on gollum/gollum#1768.


## Requirements

* An active and functional [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum#installation) installation.
* An available [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html) v7+ server instance.
  * A Docker container is provided for development of this plugin.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gollum-elasticsearch', '~> LATEST_VERSION'
```

Then execute `bundle`.

Or install the gem yourself:

```shell
$ gem install gollum-elasticsearch
```


## Configuration

TODO: Explain how to active that plugin in Gollum. Hopefully just adding a line to your gouum config file.


## Usage

This plugin is implemented as Rack middleware that overrides the `/gollum/search` request path. This means you must run Gollum as a Rack app via `config.ru` and inject this plugin _before_ Gollum.

```ruby
# config.ru

require_relative 'gollum-elasticsearch'
use Gollum::Elasticsearch::Middleware

require 'gollum/app'
Precious::App.set(:gollum_path, '/path/to/your/wiki/repo/dir')
run Precious::App
```

This plugin looks for an `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` to establish a connection to Elasticsearch. This can be defined in the above config.ru file, or in the runtime environment for your server. In development, this is set by the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to the elasticsearch Docker container.

Please check [config.ru](config.ru) for example usage. Further documentation about [launching Gollum via Rack](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Gollum-via-Rack) is available in [Gollum's own wiki](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/)



## Contributing

### Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the Gollum-Elasticsearch projectâ€™s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/beporter/gollum-elasticsearch/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


### Getting Help or Reporting Issues

[Create an issue](https://github.com/beporter/gollum-elasticsearch/issues).

TODO: Better details.


### Development

* [Create an issue](https://github.com/beporter/gollum-elasticsearch/issues) to propose and discuss the contribution.
  * The authors have little time to maintain this project. Your contributions are invited, but we wish to not waste anyone's time. A quick conversation to determine alignment and fit is usually a good investment.
* If the contribution is a good fit, clone the repo, start a topic branch, and open a pull request.

#### Workflow

* Clone the repository.
* Run `docker-compose up` to launch the development environment, which contains a ruby container running gollum and a test wiki, and an Elasticsearch container.
* Visit http://localhost:4567 to check the running copy of Gollum with this plugin injected.
  * Changes to the code in this plugin should be reloaded automatically.
  * You can override the exposed port by creating a local `.env` file and placing `GOLLUM_PORT=4568` in it.
  * You can confirm that the gollum container can reach the elasticsearch container by running `docker compose run gollum bash`, then `curl $ELASTICSEARCH_URL/_cluster/state?pretty`.
* Visit http://localhost:9200/ to check the Elasticsearch instance.
  * You can override the exposed port by creating a local `.env` file and placing `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=4568` in it.
* All normal ruby/bundler commands should be _prefixed_ with `docker compose exec gollum YOUR COMMAND HERE`.

#### Testing

It is recommended to run the test suite inside the provided Docker Compose environment.

* `docker-compose gollum bundle exec rspec` - The test suite should continue to pass.
* `docker-compose gollum bundle exec rubocop` - Rubocop should emit no warnings or errors.


#### Releasing

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
